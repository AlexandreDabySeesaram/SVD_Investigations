# Separability investigation of parametrised space clustering

This code shows the separability proprieties of different ways of clustering the 1D space into two regions. 
Two types of functions are used to do so:
* A sharp step function (Heaviside),
* A smooth one (Tanh).

In both cases the position of the jump is parametrised by a scalar parameter $\alpha$. 

Furhter investigations are conducted on moving front(s) with a 
* A gaussian function that is moving 
* Two gaussian functions moving at different rates

The code can be used interactively with [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlexandreDabySeesaram/SVD_Investigations/main?labpath=SpacePartition_Separability.ipynb)
